To achieve the requirements specified, you can create a `Makefile` with the following content:

```makefile
# Makefile for Guessing Game

# Variables
SCRIPT_FILE := guessinggame.sh
README_FILE := README.md
DATE := $(shell date)

# Count the lines of code in the script file
LOC := $(shell wc -l < $(SCRIPT_FILE))

# Target to generate README.md
$(README_FILE): $(SCRIPT_FILE)
	echo "# Guessing Game" > $(README_FILE)
	echo >> $(README_FILE)
	echo "## Description" >> $(README_FILE)
	echo >> $(README_FILE)
	echo "The Guessing Game is a simple Bash script that continuously asks the user to guess the number of files in the current directory. The user will be informed if their guess is too high or too low. Once the user guesses the correct number of files in the current directory, they will be congratulated." >> $(README_FILE)
	echo >> $(README_FILE)
	echo "## How to Play" >> $(README_FILE)
	echo >> $(README_FILE)
	echo "1. Make sure you have Bash installed on your system." >> $(README_FILE)
	echo "2. Download the \`guessinggame.sh\` script to your computer." >> $(README_FILE)
	echo "3. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the \`guessinggame.sh\` script." >> $(README_FILE)
	echo "4. Give execute permissions to the script:" >> $(README_FILE)
	echo "   \`\`\`bash" >> $(README_FILE)
	echo "   chmod +x guessinggame.sh" >> $(README_FILE)
	echo "   \`\`\`" >> $(README_FILE)
	echo "5. Run the script:" >> $(README_FILE)
	echo "   \`\`\`bash" >> $(README_FILE)
	echo "   ./guessinggame.sh" >> $(README_FILE)
	echo "   \`\`\`" >> $(README_FILE)
	echo "6. The game will start, and you will be asked to enter your guess for the number of files in the current directory." >> $(README_FILE)
	echo "7. If your guess is incorrect, the script will inform you whether your guess is too high or too low." >> $(README_FILE)
	echo "8. Keep guessing until you correctly guess the number of files in the current directory." >> $(README_FILE)
	echo "9. Once you guess correctly, the script will congratulate you and exit the loop." >> $(README_FILE)
	echo >> $(README_FILE)
	echo "## Note" >> $(README_FILE)
	echo >> $(README_FILE)
	echo "The script counts the number of files in the current directory by using the \`ls\` command. Subdirectories are not included in the count." >> $(README_FILE)
	echo >> $(README_FILE)
	echo "Feel free to modify and improve the script as you like. Have fun playing the Guessing Game!" >> $(README_FILE)
	echo >> $(README_FILE)
	echo "Enjoy! ðŸŽ‰" >> $(README_FILE)
	echo >> $(README_FILE)
	echo "The number of lines of code in \`$(SCRIPT_FILE)\` is: $(LOC)" >> $(README_FILE)
	echo "The date and time at which make was run: $(DATE)" >> $(README_FILE)

# Target to open GitHub Pages site
github_pages:
	git add $(README_FILE)
	git commit -m "Update $(README_FILE)"
	git push origin master

# Target to clean generated files
clean:
	rm -f $(README_FILE)

# Set `README.md` as a prerequisite for the default target, so it gets generated automatically when running `make`.
.DEFAULT_GOAL := $(README_FILE)
```

This `Makefile` will automatically generate the `README.md` file containing the required information each time you run the `make` command. Additionally, you can use the `make github_pages` command to commit the `README.md` file and push it to your GitHub repository, generating the GitHub Pages site. The `make clean` command will remove the `README.md` file if needed.

Ensure that both `guessinggame.sh` and the `Makefile` are present in the same directory. To generate the `README.md`, run the following command:

```bash
make
```

To update the GitHub repository and generate the GitHub Pages site, run:

```bash
make github_pages
```

Remember to commit and push the `Makefile` and `guessinggame.sh` to your GitHub repository along with the generated `README.md` file.
